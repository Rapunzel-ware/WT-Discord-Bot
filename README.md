Simple WarThunder bot for Discord

# About the Bot
The code uses a timer that runs every hour to get the latest patch notes from War Thunder website and posts them in the specified Discord channel.

Note that you need to replace YOUR_SERVER_ID and YOUR_CHANNEL_ID with the actual ID of the server and channel where you want the bot to post the patch notes. Also, you will need to implement the code to scrape the patch notes from the War Thunder website.
