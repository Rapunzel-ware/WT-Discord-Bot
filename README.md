# WT-Discord-Bot
Simple WarThunder bot for Discord

# About the Bot
The bot uses a timer that runs every hour to get the latest patch notes from War Thunder website and posts them in the specified Discord channel. It also listens for messages starting with "!wt" and returns the information from the WarThunder wiki based on the request.

Note that you need to replace YOUR_SERVER_ID and YOUR_CHANNEL_ID with the actual ID of the server and channel where you want the bot to post the patch notes. Also, you will need to implement the code to scrape the patch notes from the War Thunder website.
